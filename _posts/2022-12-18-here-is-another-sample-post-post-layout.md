Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most influential and acclaimed filmmakers of all time. He has been at the forefront of the French New Wave movement and is considered by many to be the most important filmmaker of the 20th century. His films often focus on social and political issues, as well as philosophical questions. He has often been highly critical of the traditional film industry, and has championed the use of experimental techniques.

Born in 1930 in Paris, France, Jean-Luc Godard studied literature, philosophy, and film at the University of Paris. His first feature, Breathless (1960), was a major influence in French film history and established him as a key figure of the French New Wave. He was among the first filmmakers to experiment with the fragmentation of narrative, the use of non-fiction elements, and the juxtaposition of graphic imagery and sound. He quickly achieved international fame and recognition with films like Contempt (1963), My Life To Live (1962), and Weekend (1967). Godard's work during the 1970s and 1980s made him even more of a cult figure in international film circles, as he continued to experiment with cinematic techniques, addressing political issues in films such as Numéro deux (1975), Every Man for Himself (1980), and Hail Mary (1985). He often used his films to express his political views and heavily drew from philosophy, literature, and cinema in order to make his artistic statements. In his early films such as Breathless (1960) and Alphaville (1965), Godard established himself as a leading figure of the French New Wave movement. These films were marked by their rejection of traditional Hollywood conventions, and instead sought to capture everyday reality through an innovative use of camera techniques and editing. In later works such as Weekend (1967) and Passion (1982), Godard continued to experiment with form while also addressing more overtly political themes. In these films, he explored the tensions between individual desire and societal pressures, critiquing both capitalism and communism in the process.

Godard’s films are highly praised for their unique style. His influence can still be felt in the industry today, as his teachings on artistry and narrative continue to resonate with other filmmakers. He has remained a vocal critic of Hollywood commercialization and continues to be an inspiration for aspiring filmmakers. Godard's work has been celebrated around the world, with many awards and recognitions, including the Palme d'Or, two Academy Award nominations, and two honorary awards from the Cannes Film Festival. He is also the recipient of the French Legion of Honour, the highest award given by the French government. In 2008, he was also given a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Cannes Film Festival.
