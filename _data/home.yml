Hi, my name is Kush (she/her) and I’m an independent filmmaker and video editor based in Cebu City, Philippines. 
I’m currently working as a video editor at a Singapore-based [video production company](https://fewstones.com/). 
I create and write short films and collaborate with fellow artists. My thesis film has been exhibited at independent 
film festivals in the Philippines. I have been a Notion Ambassador since November 2020

I explore technology, publish thoughts, and create [Notion template](https://krabf.gumroad.com). 

I also happen to love brewing coffee at home and my reviews can be found [here](https://coffee.krabf.com). 

More about my work [here](/work).

If you’re interested in knowing, here’s what I’m up to [right now](/now/).
