### Work
I left my role as a video editor and content producer for mental health companies earlier in 2022. Having gained invaluable insight into mental health and the people dedicated to making it as accessible as possible. 
Following my relocation to Cebu City, I was eager to find a job that provided me with opportunities for growth and learning. I then joined fewStones, a Singapore-based corporate video production company, as a Live Action Video Editor. 

### Coffee Stuff
In October 2021, I fell into the rabbit hole of coffee brewing for the first time and found a hobby that helped me through tough times. I love how coffee comes from different parts of the world and get a deeper appreciation for their differences. I promised myself that I would never make a profit from this hobby, and I am still trying to improve my skills.

### Learning Stuff.
I love the World Wide Web and computers. I can commit and deploy simple code like Jamstack stuff. I can Easy Ease in After Effects. Make logos and inforgraphics "pop". And cook good food.
