### New work
I quit my job as a video editor for IPI and PERC this year. It was a good two years and I definitely learned a lot about mental health and the people working to make it accessible as possible. While moving in Cebu City, one of my goal was to look for a job in order to grow and learn new skills. Later, I joined a Singapore-based video production company. 

### Coffee stuff
In October 2021, I fell into the rabbit hole of coffee brewing for the first time and found a hobby that helped me through tough times. I love how coffee comes from different parts of the world and get a deeper appreciation for their differences. I promised myself that I would never make a profit from this hobby, and I am still trying to improve my skills.

### Learning how to code
I love the internet. As I said, it has taught me a lot of what I know. I am still learning how to code.
